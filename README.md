# AI ML Templates

A collection of AI/ML templates for various applications including Classification, NLP, Neural Networks, PCA, and Clustering.

## Overview 

This repository provides a comprehensive set of AI/ML templates for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to quickly get started with AI/ML projects. The templates are well-commented, easy to understand, and ready to be used as a starting point for your projects.

## Templates Included

Classification: Templates for popular classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.

NLP: Templates for NLP applications including Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, and Named Entity Recognition.

Neural Networks: Templates for Neural Network models including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

PCA: Templates for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a popular dimensionality reduction technique.

Clustering: Templates for clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

## Requirements

The templates require the following packages:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow (for Neural Network templates)
Usage
To use the templates, simply clone the repository to your local machine and start modifying the code to fit your specific needs. The templates are written in Python and use Jupyter Notebooks for easy experimentation and testing.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any suggestions for additional templates or improvements to the existing ones, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
