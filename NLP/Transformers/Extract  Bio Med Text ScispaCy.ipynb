Considering the availability of biomedical literature, there has been an increasing interest in extracting information, relationships, and insights from text data. However, the unstructured organization and the domain complexity of biomedical documents make these tasks hard. Fortunately, some cool NLP Python packages can help us with that!\n","\n","scispaCy is a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text. spaCy’s most mindblowing features are neural network models for tagging, parsing, named entity recognition (NER), text classification, and more. Add scispaCy models on top of it and we can do all that in the biomedical domain!\n","\n","Here we are going to see how to use scispaCy NER models to identify drug and disease names mentioned in a medical transcription dataset. Moreover, we are going to combine NER and rule-based matching to extract the drug names and dosages reported in each transcription.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","Orginal Source - https://gbnegrini.com/post/biomedical-text-nlp-scispacy-named-entity-recognition-medical-records/ "],"metadata":{"id":"XH5ZjiC1jB_U"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Requirements\n","Python 3\n","pandas\n","spacy>=3.0\n","scispacy\n","You can simply pip install all of them.\n","\n","We also need to download and install the NER model from scispaCy.
