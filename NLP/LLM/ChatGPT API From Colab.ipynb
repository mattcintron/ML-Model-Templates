It’s easy, free, and also more powerful than the “classic” web interface at www.openai.com. In the following tutorial, I will guide you through some simple steps that will allow you to use GPT for text generation, image creation, or debugging your code!\n","\n","Orginal Source -\n","https://pub.towardsai.net/how-to-use-chatgpt-api-for-direct-interaction-from-colab-or-databricks-39969a0ead5f \n","\n","\n","<br/>\n","As the use of ChatGPT and other natural language processing (NLP) solutions increases, so does the number of tools and platforms that allow users to interact with these cutting-edge features. One of the most popular options is the OpenAI web interface, which has received widespread acclaim for its ability to handle complex NLP tasks.\n","\n","Today, however, we will explore an alternative: the ChatGPT API. This article is divided into three main sections:\n","\n","#1 Set up your OpenAI account & create an API key\n","#2 Establish the general connection from Google Colab\n","#3 Try different requests: text generation, image creation & bug fixing\n","\n","Please note: Although this tutorial was done in Google Colab (free), you may want to try other environments. For example, all the code was also applied in Databricks.\n","\n","#1 Set up your OpenAI account & create an API key\n","To interact with the GPT algorithms, you need to sign up for an OpenAI account (free of charge): https://platform.openai.com/signup/\n","\n","Once you have registered and signed up, you will need to create an API key that will allow you to send requests to OpenAI from third-party services such as Google Colab or Databricks. Navigate to the “View API Key” section via the user menu, or use the following link: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\n","\n","In this section, simply click on “Create new secret key” and save the created key somewhere on your computer (you will need it soon!).\n","\n","Please note that ChatGPT API is offering free trial usage (as of today) with limited requests and tokens per minute. See the rate limits below [1]:\n","\n","Free trial users: 20 RPM 40000 TPM\n","Pay-as-you-go users (first 48 hours): 60 RPM 60000 TPM\n","Pay-as-you-go users (after 48 hours): 3500 RPM 90000 TPM\n","(RPM = requests per minute; TPM = tokens per minute)\n","\n","#2 Establish the general connection from Colab\n","The easiest and most straightforward way to test the API is to use Google Colaboratory (“Colab”), which is something like “a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.” Although there are many more professional environments you may want to explore (e.g. Databricks), I think Colab is not a bad service to take your first steps with the ChatGPT API.\n","\n","To set up a basic environment for ChatGPT within Colab you can follow the next few steps:\n","\n","Open https://colab.research.google.com/ and register for a free account\n","Create a new notebook within Colab\n","Install & use the openai package:"],"metadata":{"id":"NxXOkCjiHwhA"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"OOrNHkW9Hq5U"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install openai"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To execute a simple chat request to the API using the GPT 3.5 turbo model (see other available models in their documentation linked at the end of this article), similar to what you know from the OpenAI web interface, you can simply execute the following lines of code in your notebook:"],"metadata":{"id":"68pOyQPVfZT0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","import openai\n","\n","openai.api_key = \"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\"\n","\n","openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n","  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","  messages=[\n","    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello ChatGPT, does this work?\"}\n","  ]\n","  )"],"metadata":{"id":"bT35YWGDIJ7k"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["As soon as you execute the command in Colab, you receive a JSON object as a response that contains the expected answer!
