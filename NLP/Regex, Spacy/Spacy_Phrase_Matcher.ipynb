Token annotations and lexical attributes such as a token.is_punct can be referenced by rules. When we apply the matcher on a Doc, we get access to the tokens that have been matched in context. This allows us to quickly access and examine the tokens around and add entries to named entities in doc.ents.\n","\n","Orginal Source -\n","https://www.educba.com/spacy-matcher/ \n","\n","## What is spaCy matcher?\n","The matcher is a rule-matching engine in spaCy that works with tokens in the same way as regular expressions. The rules can reference token annotations. We can also use a custom callback with the rule matcher to do actions on matches, such as merging entities and applying custom labels. We may also link patterns to entity IDs for essential entity linking and disambiguation. It helps match extensive terminology collections. Create token patterns and run them over our text to see how well spaCy’s rule-based matcher works. Each token can have numerous properties, such as the text value, part-of-speech tag, and Boolean flags."],"metadata":{"id":"lU6piQTPMV4w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Break Down\n","It is a rule-based phrase matcher. If we modify the attr to match on, the token attributes match will change. If validate=True is set, when patterns are introduced, additional validation is done at the moment. It will look to see if the doc has any properties that aren’t required for the matches to be produced. The pattern can be added to the matcher. Each dictionary describes a single token as well as its characteristics. Token pattern keys are accessible for a variety of Token properties.\n","\n","The following properties are supported for rule-based matching:\n","\n","ORTH: The type of ORTH attribute in spaCy matcher is str.\n","TEXT: The type of TEXT attribute in spaCy matcher is str.\n","NORM: The type of NORM attribute in spaCy matcher is str.\n","LOWER: The type of LOWER attribute in spaCy matcher is str.\n","LENGTH: The type of LENGTH attribute in spaCy matcher is int.\n","IS_ALPHA, IS_DIGIT: The type of IS_ALPHA, IS_DIGIT attribute in spaCy matcher is bool.\n","IS_LOWER, IS_UPPER: The type of IS_LOWER, IS_UPPER attribute in spaCy matcher is bool.\n","IS_SENT_START: The type of IS_SENT_START attribute in spaCy matcher is bool.\n","SPACY: The type of SPACY attribute in spaCy matcher is bool.\n","OP: The type of OP attribute in spaCy matcher is str.\n","SpaCy Matcher Phrase Matcher\n","It works with tokens in the same way as regular expressions do. We can use the matcher to set rules to match, such as IS PUNCT, IS DIGIT, and so on. Compared to utilizing regular expressions on raw text, spaCy’s allow us to access the words and phrases we are looking for and the tokens inside the document and their relationships. We get a doc object when we pass sentence through an NLP pipeline in spaCy. The doc object treats every word and punctuation as a token. A token that matches the lowercase version of “April,” such as “april” or “April.” A token with the IS DIGIT flag set to true, which means it can be any number. Any punctuation token with the IS PUNCT flag set to true. The IS DIGIT flag is set to true on this token. A list of dictionaries should be made, each containing the match pattern for a single token.
